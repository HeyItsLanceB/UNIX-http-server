This was an academic project. The goal was to build a HTTP/1.0 compliant server.

The server is largely complete, however it does lack a couple things. Primarily,
there is a problem with executing CGI scripts. As it is, it will execute the
script, but will not pass the query string. This simply needs some adjustment
with the way execve() is being used and I haven't gotten around to it.

There are a few other things I would still like to implement:

 - small error library that will return 502 to the client if there is a problem
 - POST support (currently only GET and HEAD are supported)
 - magic file support - this would really make it fully functional although I
   have not been able to find a simple way to do this.
